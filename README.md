# U.S-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing the information I have. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present this information.
